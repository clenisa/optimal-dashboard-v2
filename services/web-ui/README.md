## 🎯 Getting Started - Production Deployment Ready

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or Bun (Latest LTS recommended)
- Supabase project with authentication enabled
- Modern browser with ES6+ support

### Lightning-Fast Installation

1. **Clone and Install**:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd optimal-os
   npm install # or bun install (recommended for speed)
   \`\`\`

2. **Enterprise Supabase Configuration**:
   - Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Enable Email and Google authentication providers
   - **Crucially, add `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` to your list of Redirect URLs in the Supabase dashboard under URL Configuration.**
   - Create `.env.local`:
     \`\`\`
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
     \`\`\`

3. **Google OAuth Setup** (Production Ready):
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials in Google Cloud Console
   - Add authorized origins: `http://localhost:3000`, your production domain
   - Add authorized redirect URIs: Your Supabase auth callback URL (e.g., `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`)
   - Configure credentials in Supabase Authentication settings

4. **Development Server**:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run dev # or bun dev (blazing fast)
   \`\`\`

5. **Production Build**:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run build && npm start # Production-optimized build
